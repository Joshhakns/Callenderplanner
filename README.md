# Callendar Planer Challenge
## Description
## I worked on this project in order to gain experience in using WEB APIs. It was good practice for me to be able to use code that was already written and expand upon what was already there. It provides me with ample opportunity to change things and tweak things until they look the way I want them too. All while updating the time on the callendar with the date and local time.
